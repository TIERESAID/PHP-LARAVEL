# TASK  ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

## String processors
(Required) Is palindrome?
Indicates whether the input string is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards). Case insensitive. Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.

Example strings and results:

"racecar" => Yes
"Racecar" => Yes
"racecar!" => Yes
"!racecar!" => Yes
"Hello World" => No

## (Required) Vowel count

Indicates a count of how many vowels (aeiou) are in the input string. Case insensitive.

Example strings and results:

"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" => 11
"Hll Wrld" => 0
"AeIoU" => 5

## (Optional) Letter shift
Processes an input string such that each letter is shifted +1 position in the alphabet.

So a becomes b, b becomes c, [...], z becomes a.

Capitalization should be retained so A becomes B, B becomes C, [...], Z becomes A.

Any non-alphabetic characters should be left as is.

Example strings and results:

"The zoo is open" => "Uif app jt pqfo"
"foobar@1" => "gppcbs@1"
"aAb" => "bBc"

## (Optional) Create your own...
Design one additional processor that is similar in concept to the above tasks in that it provides some calculation and/or takes some input and produces some altered result. <br> <br>
